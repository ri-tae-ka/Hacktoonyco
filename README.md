<p align="center">Hacktoonyco is a web-based application that allows you to play anime-related games, search engine for anime lovers, and has a machine learning feature where you can toonify a human's image.</p>

## Inspiration

Toru Kimi no anime Keiken Ni InkurÅ«do Tsuki ðŸš€
We took inspiration from various anime characters and series like Kamisama Kiss, Boa Hancock, and Nanami. We wanted to build something that would let users have a look at an animated version of themselves and their friends.

## What it does

We have two-three features which engage an anime lover towards his/her favorite character. Some of the features are: A game where your favorite anime character eats and earn points, after earning all the points they get to reveal the image below, and this project has a creative attribute where you can compare your faces with your favorite anime character.

## How we built it

We built it using React.js for the frontend, fast API to build backend, we used Deep AI to make the toonify feature. And used Google App Engine to host the backend.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into multiple challenges while working on this project. The main challenge was combining our various skills as front-end and back-end developers. We had to learn to coordinate and learn a bit about each. The next challenges we faced were connecting the APIs and making sure they were linked at all times. In the front-end sector, we had a few problems with getting the CSS working, since we had to combine multiple files from each group member into one. Lastly, there was many other problems going in the background both personal and non-personal

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of all the work we did! We spent the whole weekend working on our passion project. the front-end developers learned a bit of React.js and the back-end developers learned a bit of Ui skills. We shared our knowledge and spent a huge amount of time working on the facial recognition feature.

## What we learned

The biggest lesson for us was to manage our expectations. We wanted to build multiple features but quickly realized that it was wiser to build a few but with perfection. The front-end developers learned the basics of coding languages that were new for them. The back-end developers honed their coding skills and contributing to the Ui of the website.

## What's next for Hacktoonyco

We plan on taking it to the next level! Hacktoonyco will soon have new features which will allow users to share their animated avatars with their friends via the website and play more new anime-based games.
